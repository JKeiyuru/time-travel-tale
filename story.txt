I was never meant to be here. The year was 2125, and the world had long abandoned the idea of time travel as fiction. 
But I wasn’t a scientist or a soldier; I was just an ordinary guy, working a dead-end job, until the night I found the watch. 
It wasn’t ticking—just a relic, or so I thought. But the moment I put it on, I felt a sharp pull, like gravity itself had wrapped around me.
When I opened my eyes, the city I knew was gone. And it was only the beginning.
