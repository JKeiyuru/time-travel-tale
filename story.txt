I was never meant to be here. The year was 2125, and the world had long abandoned the idea of time travel as fiction. 
But I wasn’t a scientist or a soldier; I was just an ordinary guy, working a dead-end job, until the night I found the watch. 
It wasn’t ticking—just a relic, or so I thought. But the moment I put it on, I felt a sharp pull, like gravity itself had wrapped around me.
When I opened my eyes, the city I knew was gone. And it was only the beginning.

(PAST)
In our time, the world felt on the edge of something—technology was advancing at breakneck speed, but chaos always seemed one step ahead. 
We had smartphones, social media, and AI, but we were still bound by the same old problems: inequality, climate anxiety, and a growing sense of 
disconnection despite being more "connected" than ever. It was an era of constant noise—news cycles spun faster than we could process, and everyone 
was in a rush to nowhere. We believed we were shaping the future, but in truth, we were only barely holding it together.

(FUTURE)

In 2125, the world was a gleaming utopia on the surface—skyscrapers stretched into the clouds, connected by shimmering bridges of light, and vehicles zipped through the air in perfect harmony. 
The old scars of climate disasters were buried beneath cities that thrived on renewable energy, and disease had been virtually eradicated. 
But beneath the perfection, society was hollow. Human connection had faded, replaced by lifeless digital interactions, and everything was governed by an algorithm so precise, it decided your future before you were even born.
People lived longer, but no one truly lived anymore.
